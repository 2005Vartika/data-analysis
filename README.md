# data-analysis
## Problem Statement:
Despite the rich history of the Olympic Games, the underlying trends and patterns in medal distribution, athlete performance, and the evolution of sports disciplines are not readily accessible. There is a need for an analytical solution that processes, stores, and visualizes this data to support strategic decision-making in sports management, media, and national sports programs.
## Project Objectives:
•	Analyze historical Olympic data from 1896 to 2024 to identify key trends.
•	Examine medal distributions across countries and sports.
•	Identify top-performing athletes and their impact over time.
•	Track the evolution and popularity of various sports disciplines.
•	Detect trends in Olympic participation by countries and athletes.
•	Store processed data in an Oracle 23ai database for efficient querying.
•	Enable interactive analysis through Tableau dashboards.
## Key Features:
•	Data Ingestion & Cleaning: Automated extraction, cleansing, and transformation of Olympic data (handling encoding issues, missing values, etc.).
•	Big Data Processing: Use of PySpark to aggregate and analyze data at scale.
•	Database Integration: Seamless integration with Oracle 23ai for storing processed results.
•	Interactive Visualization: Dynamic dashboards built in Tableau to explore trends and insights.

## Additional Setup:
Make sure to have JDK version 17 on your system
Oracle Database 23ai
Add to path variable
C:\app\<username>\product\23ai\dbhomeFree\jdbc\lib
Have ojdbc17.jar and the base csv file in the same directory.
Make sure to have Hadoop in your system.
